Those types are “n” for normal, “w” for weekends, and “h” for holidays. The employee having the highest increment is next in line to pull duty.&#10; - The initial increment starting numbers can be edited directly in the roster itself by changing the values in the increment columns labeled ‘n’, ‘w’, or ‘h’. The normal ‘n’ increment is always used to mark regular days, or weekdays when the ‘weekends’ option is enabled in the roster settings. The weekend ‘w’ increment only increments when the ‘weekends’ option is enabled. &#10; - The holidays ‘h’ increment only increments when the ‘holidays’ option is enabled, and only on holidays that are added to the holiday editor.&#10;&#10;Roster Priority, Duty Conflicts, and Rest Periods&#10; - An employee that is currently pulling duty, or detailed (depicted by the letter ‘D’) on a higher priority roster is exempt from pulling duty on all lower priority rosters for that time period, plus the additional rest time period (depicted by the letter ‘A’) on both rosters. When an employee has been detailed, the increment number will continue to increase for that specific day. The rest time period is determined by the longest rest time between both rosters that are being compared. Rest time is considered a pass, so the increment number does not increase during that period.&#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" />
